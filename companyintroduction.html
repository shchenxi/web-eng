              <h3 class="title">COMPANY VISION</h3>
							<p>DEW(microraindrop) Company is a newly-built high-tech software company dedicated to the construction and provision of cloud platforms. We believe one of the tendency that in the construction of private clouds , public clouds and hybrid clouds around the world, it is a market segment of edge computing should including all of the function and technology such as cloud computing, cloud Services, cloud storage, big data, Internet of Things, intelligent platforms, disaster backup, cloud search. A variety of open source products have a huge number of types and systems, the under-level platforms of giants clouds are also a big difference, users on the virtual cloud can't see the low-level things, and also don't have the ability to build a comprehensive integrated private cloud solution. If you can integrate these technologies and provide one-click installation and graphical maintenance, we believe that some users and enterprises will have their own private cloud solutions. Our business model is to provide free platform and unified platform, only charge for some data migration, application development etc. <br/>
All the technologies, if the user can install the same key as the ordinary software, this is similar to the concept of fog calculation proposed by Cisco. The company is called Dew Computing, DEW Cloud Technology, or this solution is called real. The arrival of the era of fog computing. <br/>
This is also a new ecology illustrated.

							<h3 class="title" >Why choose CEPH as the cornerstone of the fusion solution and  Technology</h3>
							<p> 
							1. GPFS <br/>
Gpfs (general parallel file system, is a distributed file system. Developed and owned by jbm, this is a proprietary, closed source storage system. This makes it unattractive and difficult to adapt to. Storage hardware plus authorization and support costs make it very expensive. In addition, it provides very limited access to storage; It can not provide block storage, nor can it provide restful access to the storage system, so it is a very restrictive system, and even the maximum number of data copies is limited to only three. This reduces the reliability of the system when multiple components fail at the same time<br/>
2. iRODS <br/>
Irdos is a representative of the current data system. It is an open source data management software released under the bsd protocol of 3-clause. Irdos is not a highly reliable storage system because its icat metadata server is a single point of (single point of failure.spof), and it does not provide a real ha. In addition. It provides limited storage interfaces; Can neither provide block storage nor provide restful interfaces to access the child storage system, so this is a very restrictive system that is more suitable for storing a small number of large files. Instead of storing small files and large files at the same time, irdos uses the traditional way to maintain an index of physical locations (associated with file names). Since multiple clients need to request file locations from the metadata server, the metadata server needs to be subjected to additional computational load, resulting in a single point of failure and performance bottlenecks<br/>
3. HDFS <br/>
Hdfs is a distributed extensible file system written in] ava and created for the hadoop framework. Hdfs is not a fully posix compatible file system and does not support block storage. This makes it less reliable than ceph.hdfs because it is not a highly available file system. The single point of failure and performance bottleneck in hdfs are mainly due to its single namenode node. It is more suitable for storing a small number of large files than for both small files and large files.<br/>
4. Lustre <br/>
Lustre is a parallel distributed file system driven by the open source community and released under the gnu (general public license, General Public license. In lustre, since there is only one single server responsible for storing and managing metadata. As a result, all I / O requests from the client depend entirely on the computing power of the server, but for enterprise computing, the server's computing power is usually low. Like irdos and hdfs, lustre is ideal for storing a small number of large files rather than both small files and large files. Like irdos, lustre manages an index file for mapping physical locations and filenames, which determines that it is a traditional architecture and prone to performance bottlenecks. Lustre does not have any node fault detection and correction mechanisms. In the event of a node failure, the client can only connect to other nodes on its own<br/>
5. Gluster <br/>
Glusterfs was originally developed by gluster, which was acquired by red hat in 2011. Glusterfs is a horizontally extended network attachment (network-attacbed) file system. In gluster, administrators must specify which placement strategy to use to store copies of data on different locales. G1uster itself does not have built-in block access, file systems and remote replicas, but is supported as an extension (add-ons).<br/>
6. CEPH <br/> 
If we compare ceph with other existing storage solutions, because of the rich nature of ceph, it's obviously different. It overcomes the limitations of existing storage systems. And has proven to be an ideal replacement for expensive old storage systems that are open source software defined storage solutions running on any commercial hardware, This also makes it an economical storage solution. Ceph provides a variety of interfaces to enable clients to connect to ceph clusters, which adds flexibility to clients. For data protection, ceph does not depend on the frame of rald technology, because it has all the limitations mentioned above, but adopts replica and erasure code scheme which has been proved to be better than raid. <br/>
Each component of ceph is reliable and supports high availability. If you keep redundancy in mind when configuring ceph components, we can confidently say that ceph does not run at any single point of failure. And one of the biggest challenges of today's other storage solutions, ceph, is its unified nature, which provides off-the-shelf storage solutions for blocks, files, and objects. Other storage systems still do not have this feature. Ceph is suitable for storing both small and large files without any performance problems.<br/>
Ceph is a distributed storage system, the client can interact with ceph quickly it does not use the traditional data storage method to maintain a metadata bound to a physical location or file. Instead, it introduces a new mechanism that allows clients to dynamically compute the location of the data they need. This improves client performance. Because they no longer have to wait for the location and content of data to be retrieved from the metadata server. In addition, within the ceph cluster, the location of data is absolutely transparent and automated; clients and administrators do not need to worry about where data is stored in different areas of the radiation barrier, and ceph's intelligent systems manage all this automatically<br/>

Ceph's intelligent system manages all this automatically. < br/ > ceph is designed as a self-healing and autonomous system. In a disaster, ceph is rock solid when other storage systems cannot reliably cope with multiple failures. Ceph can detect and correct each fault area. For example: disk, node, network, rack, container data center, even different regions. Ceph attempts to automatically manage the failure and fix it as much as possible before the data is interrupted. Other storage solutions provide at most disk reliability or reliability in the event of node failure. <br/>
By comparison, these features alone can make ceph outstanding<br/>
Summary<br/>
Ceph is an open source software-defined storage solution that runs on commercial hardware, freeing enterprises from expensive, restrictive, dedicated storage systems. It provides a unified, distributed, highly scalable and highly reliable object storage solution, which is well suited to today's and future unstructured data storage needs. The demand for storage in today's world is exploding. So we need a storage system like this. It can be extended to several megabytes without compromising data reliability and system performance. Ceph stands the test of the future and provides solutions to all these problems. Ceph meets the real cloud storage solution requirements. And supports almost all cloud platforms. From any point of view today, ceph is a grand storage solution<br/><br/>
