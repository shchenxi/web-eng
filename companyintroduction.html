              				<h3 class="title">COMPANY VISION</h3>
							<p>
								DEW(microraindrop) Company is a newly-built high-tech software company dedicated to the construction and provision of cloud platforms. We believe one of the tendency that in the construction of private clouds , public clouds and hybrid clouds around the world, it is a market segment of edge computing should including all of the function and technology such as cloud computing, cloud Services, cloud storage, big data, Internet of Things, intelligent platforms, disaster backup, cloud search. A variety of open source products have a huge number of types and systems, the under-level platforms of giants clouds are also a big difference, users on the virtual cloud can't see the low-level things, and also don't have the ability to build a comprehensive integrated private cloud solution. If you can integrate these technologies and provide one-click installation and graphical maintenance, we believe that some users and enterprises will have their own private cloud solutions. Our business model is to provide free platform and unified platform, only charge for some data migration, application development etc. <br/>
								All the technologies, if the user can install the same key as the ordinary software, this is similar to the concept of fog calculation proposed by Cisco. The company is called Dew Computing, DEW Cloud Technology, or this solution is called real. The arrival of the era of fog computing. <br/>
								This is also a new ecology illustrated.

							<h3 class="title">MARKET　SEGMENT ANALYSIS</h3>
							<p>
							Known to all，Cloud and virtual technology is the direction of development and it's also the original intention of free software in the international community<br/><br/>
							The advantages：<br/>
							1.Centralized construction, centralized maintenance, centralized development, virtual sharing of resources<br/>
							2.Low initial cost for users to easily access cloud services<br/><br/>
							The disadvantages：<br/>
							1.The Technology on the Cloud and the system of Seven countries and eight at the Lower level<br/>
							2.Ordinary users do not know how to build their own cloud facilities<br/>
							3.Services in the cloud are not differentiated enough, especially for some R & D enterprises<br/>
							4. With the integrated application of home network, the demand for Internet of things is increasing day by day.<br/>
							5. Cloud service providers are still losing money, expensive server 10-year update cycle is coming<br/>
							6. Big companies always want to see the business in their cloud for their customers<br/>
							7. Private cloud, corporate cloud is not free, there must be a company in the name of the service charged by nodes, this is not the the original intention of international community open source software.
							</p>
							<br/>
							<h3 class="title" >Company core technology　KNOW-HOW</h3>
							<p>
							1. Based on DEW Automation TEST FRAMEWORK (it can configure thousands parameter in dozens of modules, it can auto configure the Linux parameters too for the unit testing) , The performance testing merge the benchmark testing like:TPC-DS,TPC-H，YCSB，HiBench，NNbench， DFSIO etc<br/>
							2. Integrated integration capabilities, New development of clusters based on open source file system technology, providing one-click installation of all the following modules and technologies<br/>
