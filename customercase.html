											<h2>Finance</h2>
											<p><strong>--What is being changed by Financial Big data Analysis is not only technology but an era.</strong></p>
												<p></p>
												<img src="content-images/finance.jpg"  >    
												<p>
												Most banks, financial services and insurance organizations (BFSI) are now undergoing a transformation to develop their businesses and improve the quality of customer service through a data-driven approach. Due to the large number of served customers, the financial industry has complex business types and high degree of informationization, and naturally has the characteristics of “massive users and big data”. such as:<br/>
In terms of scale, financial institutions now implement computer processing for all core business systems, and store and process large amounts of data all the time. The financial industry has a lot of customer information, savings information, product profiles, quotation data, market data and trading transaction data, etc.The New York Stock Exchange alone writes more than 1 tb of data a day;<br/>
In terms of speed, concurrent massive user access and transaction requests mean that higher service processing speed is required. For example, at the peak of payment, the peak value of network payment can reach 256000 per second, and the peak value of database processing can reach 42 million times per second. It is clear that this is far beyond the processing capacity of traditional databases;<br/>
There is, of course, the diversity of data. Among the data generated by financial institutions themselves, there are some structured data, such as the amount of deposits of customers, the amount of loans, the number of purchases of financial products, and so on. The storage of this part of data is relatively small, and the amount of data is more. The mining value is more than those of semi-structured or unstructured data, such as copies of user identification and asset proof, behavior data, social network data and so on.<br/>
Of course, the requirements of banking regulators for data management and monitoring are also constantly rising. In the 13th Five-Year Plan for the Information Construction of China's Financial Industry, The "13th Five-Year Plan" Supervision guidance for Information Technology in China's Banking Industry both mentioned the need to strengthen data management, control and control, improve the quality of data information, and adopt data mining and big data technology to make deep use of them. Extract data to improve management and control effectiveness.<br/>
Clearly, big data is no longer just a term, banks and other financial institutions have become an inevitable trend in the choice of big data technology.
</p>
												<p>	
Financial big data's core technology can not do without dealing with the following things: obtaining data, storing data, analyzing data and application data.<br/>
Simply put, corresponding to a big data analysis platform, there may be a data generation layer, a data exchange layer, a data storage and computing layer, a data application layer and a user access layer.<br/>
In the data generation layer, it is the structured, semi-structured and unstructured data generated from inside and outside the enterprise, and then through the data exchange layer, the data is extracted from the source, cleaned and exchanged between the components of big data platform. In the data storage and computing layer, the data can be sorted and stored after cleaning by hdfs, S2, hbase, cassandra and other software, and the data processing and access requirements of the upper layer will be responded to by mapreduce,spark,storm and other frameworks and algorithms. Of course, these requirements correspond to various interface requests and user operations in the data application layer and the user access layer, such as dashboards, reports, real-time queries, multidimensional analysis, mining predictions, and so on.<br/>
To put it simply, the huge data content of the banking industry needs to go through many cycles from "data acquisition, clean-up / integration, data warehouse, process scheduling, data mining to knowledge application", which will reflect the great application value. And how to "open" the multi-source heterogeneous data, data integration and modeling analysis, is one of the biggest problems that organizations are facing at present.<br/>
The financial industry's choice of big data, in addition to the government's push, of course, from the most practical business driven.<br/>
According to McKinsey, using data to make better marketing decisions could boost marketing productivity by 15-20 percent-a figure that could be as high as $200 billion, taking into account an average of $1 trillion a year in global marketing spending. For bfsi, the main business drivers are precision marketing, risk control, business optimization and business innovation.<br/>
												</p>

												<p>	
Precision marketing: under the impact of Internet finance, bfsi organizations urgently need to master more user information, including basic personal data, transaction history, browsing history, services and so on; The data-based analysis can help them to construct accurate user portrait, understand the customer and carry on the customer segmentation, thus carry on the individualized and intelligent marketing such as precision marketing, real-time marketing and so on.</p>
												<p>	
Risk control: with big data technology, institutions can uniformly manage internal and external heterogeneous data, external credit information and user social network data, by providing more automated processes. More accurate forecasting system and less risk of failure improve the forecasting ability of risk model and save cost significantly. Big data has many areas of application and value in risk management, including fraud management, credit management, market and commercial lending, operational risk and integrated risk management.</p>
												<p>	
Management optimization: with the help of big data decision analysis, we can understand business data more accurately, improve management decision, provide reliable data support for management, and make business decision more efficient and agile. Of course, big data can also make the management know the actual working efficiency of employees in real time from the business performance, so as to formulate relevant management measures and realize organizational incentives.</p>
												<p>	
Business innovation: business data sharing and data mining based on big data platform can better understand user needs, carry out business innovation, improve interaction with customers and increase user stickiness. Continue to enhance the core competitiveness of banking business.</p>
												<p>
As a cloud service to better understand the financial business, the financial industry cloud solutions are already providing a secure and reliable it infrastructure for a number of banks, securities, insurance and Internet financial institutions, big data said. Artificial intelligence and Baidu ecological support and other services, and through artificial intelligence, security protection, intelligent acquisition, big data risk control, it system, payment and other six technical capabilities to enable partners.</p>

											<h2>Industry</h2>
											<p><strong>--The application of industrial big data is always at the summit of technological innovation and revolution</strong></p>
											<img src="content-images/industry.jpg" > 
											<p>
Big data refers to the typical intelligent manufacturing model in the industrial field, from customer demand to sales, order, planning, R & D, design, process, manufacturing, purchasing, supply, inventory, delivery and delivery, after-sales service, operation and maintenance. All kinds of data and related technologies and applications produced by the whole life cycle of the whole product such as scrap or remanufacturing. With product data as its core, it greatly extends the range of traditional industrial data, and also includes relevant technologies and applications of industrial big data.
											</p>
											<p>	
There are three main sources of industrial big data: <br/>
the first category of  is related to production and business data. Mainly from the traditional enterprise information scope, is collected and stored in the enterprise information system, including traditional industrial design and manufacturing software, enterprise resource planning (erp), product lifecycle management (plm), supply chain management (scm), Customer relationship Management (crm) and Environmental Management system (ems). Through some enterprise information system has accumulated a large amount of product research and development data, production data, operating data, customer information data, logistics supply data and environmental data. This kind of data is the traditional data asset in the industrial field, and is gradually expanding in the environment of new technology application such as mobile Internet. <br/> 
the second category is the equipment and material connection data. Mainly refers to the industrial production equipment and the target product under the Internet of things operation mode, the real-time production covers the operation and the operation situation, the operating condition, the environment parameter and so on manifests the equipment and the product operation state data. This kind of data is the industry big data's new, the fastest-growing source. In a narrow sense, industrial big data refers to this kind of data, that is, a large number of data produced rapidly by industrial equipment and products and with time series differences. <br/> 
the third category is external data. Refers to the industrial enterprise production activities and products related to the enterprise external Internet source data, for example, to evaluate the environmental performance of the enterprise environmental laws and regulations, to predict the product market macroeconomic data, and so on.
											</p> 			
											<p>	
The application of <br/> 
in intelligent manufacturing industry big data is the key technology of intelligent manufacturing, whose main function is to open up the physical world and information world and to promote the transition from production-oriented manufacturing to service-oriented manufacturing. It has a wide application prospect in intelligent manufacturing. In the whole life cycle process of product demand acquisition, product research and development, manufacture, operation, service and recycling, industrial big data is intelligently designing and intelligentizing production. Networked collaborative manufacturing, intelligent service, personalized customization and other scenarios all play a great role.
											</p> 			
											<p>	
The relationship with big data Technology <br/> 
Industrial big data Application is based on industrial data, using advanced big data related thinking, tools, and methods throughout all aspects of industrial design, process, production, management, service, etc. Make industrial system and industrial product have intelligent function mode and result such as description, diagnosis, prediction, decision making and control. The accumulation of data in the industrial field is of a certain order of magnitude, which is beyond the processing capacity of traditional technology. Therefore, we need to use big data technology to improve processing capacity and efficiency. Big data technology provides technical and managerial support for industrial big data. <br/>
											</p> 			
											<p>	
The relation with the industrial software <br/> 
refers to the related software and systems which are mainly used or specially used in the industrial field to improve the level of industrial R & D design, business management, production scheduling and process control. The relationship between industrial big data and industrial software: firstly, industrial software bears the task of collecting and processing industrial big data and is an important source of industrial data. Secondly, industrial software support to achieve industrial big data system integration and information penetration. For example, the traditional industrial software takes erp as the center for data communication, and the new industrial software will be systemically integrated based on key software such as plm. Through the integration of external design tools, distributed R & D team, mes and control system, third party management software, etc., the information of factory from bottom big data to upper layer can be realized. Promoting the aggregation of "information island" into "information continent" <br/> 
industrial cloud is an intelligent service that provides service support for industry through the integration of information resources. Through cloud computing, the Internet of things, big data and industrial software and other technical means, the organic combination of people, machines, materials, knowledge and so on, for industry to build a unique service ecosystem, providing users with resources and capacity sharing services. Such as cloud storage service, cloud application service, cloud community service, cloud management service, cloud design service and cloud manufacturing service, etc. <br/> 
industry is the foundation and pillar of national economy, as well as an important symbol of a country's economic strength and competitiveness. With the development of cloud computing, big data, Internet of things and other emerging technologies, the world has set off a new round of industrial reform, which takes the transformation and upgrading of manufacturing industry as the primary task. The major industrial developed countries in the world have formulated industrial redevelopment strategies one after another.
											</p> 			
											<p>		
Made in China 2025 Strategy <br/>
 in May 2015, the State Council officially issued the "made in China 2025" plan. In the plan, it is proposed to promote the integration of information technology and industry depth, to take intelligent manufacturing as the main direction of attack for the deep integration of the two types of production, to focus on the development of intelligent equipment and intelligent products, to promote the intelligentization of production processes, and to foster a new mode of production. Through the construction of intelligent factory, intelligent production and intelligent manufacturing can be realized, and the shift from centralized production to networked cooperative production is realized. From traditional manufacturing enterprises to cross-border integration enterprises and from mass production to mass customization production, the overall improvement of enterprise research and development, production, management and service intelligent level. In December of the same year, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the National Standards Commission jointly issued the guidelines for the Construction of the National Intelligent Manufacturing Standard system (2015 Edition). In the guide the intelligent manufacturing standard system will be built and gradually perfected in 5 years. The problem of the integration of the standard system and the lack of the basic standard will be solved and a relatively perfect intelligent manufacturing standard system will be established. The guide identifies industrial big data as one of the five key technologies in the intelligent system of big data standard system, and defines industrial big data standard.
											</p> 			
											<p>		
In order to promote the construction of intelligent factories, the State Council has also issued the "outline for Action for promoting big data's Development", which systematically deploys the work of big data's development, and promotes big data's industrial research and development design, production and manufacture, operation and management, and marketing. The whole life cycle of products such as after-sales service, the application of the whole process of industry chain, the analysis of perceived user needs, the promotion of added value of products, and the creation of intelligent factories. Set up different industries, different links of industrial big data resources aggregation and analysis application platform. Seize the opportunity of cross-border convergence of Internet, promote big data, Internet of things, cloud computing and 3D (3D) printing technology, personalized customization in the manufacturing industry chain integration, promote manufacturing model change and industrial transformation and upgrading. With the implementation of the strategy of intelligent manufacturing transformation in the major countries of the world, industrial big data will increasingly become an important means for the global manufacturing industry to tap its value and promote change.

											<h2>Government</h2>
											<p><strong>--The construction of a smart government is the nuclear power to promote the development of smart cities.</strong></p>
											<img src="content-images/gev.jpg" > 
											<p>
The construction of intelligent cities in China has made remarkable achievements, and the enthusiasm for construction has been growing day by day. Up to now, 100 percent of the cities above the sub-provincial level, more than 76 percent of the prefectural cities and 32 percent of the county-level cities have made clear that they are building new intelligent cities.
											</p> 			
											<p>			
The construction of wisdom city can not be separated from intelligent government. As for the wisdom government, we believe that the intelligent government is based on the construction of the intelligent city, using the technical means to form the government form in the virtual space and to fulfill the responsibility of the entity government. Intelligent government has the ability of judgment, analysis, choice, action and self-adaptation, as well as the ability of moral judgment and choice. Intelligent government will form its own data accumulation, information accumulation, knowledge accumulation, and form its own values, such as sustainable development concept, fair and just view and so on.
											</p> 			
											<p>		
As the Internet of things, cloud computing, mobile Internet, web2.0 and other new generation of information technology emerging and development, government affairs have become increasingly complex. As early as 2012, people put forward the concept of "e-government 2.0", and explained that the trend of government informatization should be gradually transformed from "production era" to "consumption era", which focused on efficient application. An intelligent, individualized view of change. Now, with the rapid development of information technology, e-government has entered a new stage of development-intelligent government. "the construction of government informatization has gone through many stages, such as traditional government, digital government, e-government, mobile government, etc., although it has become more and more mature, but the mode of government resource sharing still needs to be perfected, because of many factors such as the inconsistency of information standard, etc. Government information resources are still scattered in various departments, information islands still exist, repeated construction occurs from time to time.
											</p> 			
											<p>													
Indeed, a scientific mode of government resource sharing and unified information standards will undoubtedly help managers, designers, program providers and contractors of urban construction to establish a unified knowledge system for the construction of a new type of intelligent city. And according to the coordinated requirements to carry out the construction of various fields, to ensure the construction of new intelligent cities more standardized, intensive, orderly.
											</p> 			
											<p>		
It is worth noting that, for a long time, in order to avoid the lack of a "top-level design", cities in the construction of intelligent cities have their own affairs, information isolated islands, repeated construction, and so on. In June 2018, the State Administration of Market Supervision and Administration, the State Administration of Market Supervision and Administration, The State Standardization Administration Committee has issued the National Standard of the guidelines for the Top Design of Wisdom cities (hereinafter referred to as the "Design guidelines"), which will be officially implemented on January 1, 2019.
											</p> 			
											<p>		
Among them, in the wisdom city top level design should follow the basic principle, "the design guide" pointed out, first is adheres to the person-oriented. To "for the people, convenience, benefit the people" as the guide. Second, because of the city to give policy. According to the city strategic orientation, history and culture, resource endowment, information base and the level of economic and social development, scientific positioning, rational allocation of resources, targeted planning and design. Third, integration and sharing. The goal is to achieve data fusion, business integration, technology convergence, and collaborative management and services across departments, systems, businesses, hierarchies, and regions. Fourth, coordinated development. It reflects the convergence and radiation application of data in urban agglomeration, central cities and surrounding counties and towns, and establishes the system of urban management, industrial development, social security, public service and so on.
											</p> 			
											<p>		
In terms of innovation-driven, the Design Guide proposes that the application of new technologies in intelligent cities, the organic combination between smart cities and innovation and entrepreneurship should be embodied, and the intelligent cities should be regarded as an important carrier of innovation-driven, so as to promote the overall planning mechanism. Management mechanism, operation mechanism, information technology innovation. In addition, the design guidelines also put forward the basic principles of multiple participation, green development and so on.
											</p> 			
											<p>		
In addition to introducing top-level design guidelines at the national level and speeding up the construction of smart government at the national level and better building smart cities, research and development companies engaged in smart government are also working hard. After years of accumulation and development, a new breakthrough has been made in the construction of virtual government. In the aspect of intensive design, we adopt the idea of integration of the bottom layer, the theory of co-evolution in personalized design of business, the platform of "Internet government cloud service", which is data-centered and dominated by "software as a service" pattern.<br/>
											</p> 			
											<p>
On innovation, we should pay attention to mode innovation in building intelligent government. In this respect, there are several major innovations. One is from top level design to unified construction of intelligent government cloud application software application service (saas) platform based on software and Internet. Using one-to-many software delivery mode, that is, a set of software multi-user use, to achieve personalized applications, data isolation and other requirements, rich, convenient, The high quality cloud service makes the management information develop toward the cloud. <br/>
 is from the system to the data service aspect, the data generation value of the data age is more and more great, among them, the big data that the government department grasps, relates to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Higher value density. On the basis of summing up the experience of many years of government affairs construction, it should be said that the functions of the existing e-government system can no longer satisfy the specific data services, and the demand for government data planning, governance, monitoring and other services has increased explosively. The results of this research and development can provide componentized, extensible data planning, data governance, data monitoring and data services. The improvement from internal logic to comprehensive consideration of the internal and external connection of the system will help to upgrade the traditional government information construction mechanism and thus create a new pattern of intelligent government.

											<h2>School</h2>
											<p><strong>--The construction of a smart campus has been put on the agenda and is  growing vigorously</strong></p>
											<img src="content-images/school.jpg" > 
											<p>
University information application system has accumulated a large amount of historical data in daily teaching and management, but these massive data have not been effectively analyzed and used. In the daily data input and maintenance, the staff of each department only get some superficial, superficial and low value results by simply operating the data through statistics and sorting. Build a big data analysis platform, extract huge amounts of data from other school application platforms for management, integration, analysis and utilization, discover potential problems and valuable laws, and display them visually. It can provide scientific decision support for school management and meet the individualized needs of teachers and students so as to improve the quality of information service in colleges and universities.
												</p> 			
												<p>	
1. Build target <br/>
(1) to share and exchange data. To integrate and integrate the data of school application systems so that all kinds of data of different sources and types can be used each other, enrich the sources of data, break the isolated islands of information between systems, Data sharing and application. <br/> 
(2) big data acquisition and storage. The data adaptation interface is developed, and all kinds of heterogeneous data are obtained through the internal application system, and the main framework and system of big data are used to store the data in a unified way. To lay a good foundation for data mining and analysis. <br/> 
(3) big data analysis and decision-making. By using data mining, mathematical statistics and other related techniques, this paper constructs big data analysis framework, extracts hidden, unknown and potentially valuable information and rules from the data, and provides educational administration, scientific research management and student management for the school. Logistics management and other work to provide decision-making and guidance.
												</p> 			
												<p>												
2. Build principle <br/> 
(1) Security. There is a lot of confidentiality in the information work of colleges and universities. Big data's analysis platform should adopt a high security access authentication mechanism. At the same time, we should pay more attention to the security of the system itself and other application systems in the platform construction. <br/> 
(2) extensibility. The analysis and application of big data in college education is a long-term and lasting work. With the emphasis of management and the change of educational information work, the scale and requirements of information platform will be constantly changed. Therefore, the design and implementation of the platform should have good scalability to meet the changing requirements. <br/> 
(3) flexibility. In the design and implementation of the platform, we should consider the integration with other application systems, develop multiple types of interfaces, be able to access other systems flexibly, and expand the types of services. <br/>
</p>
<p>
3. The overall framework <br/> 
platform should be adapted to big data's processing requirements and can support pb level data management. System architecture should be high-security, extensible, able to support all kinds of mainstream development languages, and provide rich interfaces. Can support both structured and unstructured data storage and application. <br/>
												</p> 			
												<p>	
To realize the overall innovation of teaching and management and to construct the analysis platform of big data in colleges and universities is an innovative exploration based on the strategic development plan of colleges and universities and on the basis of the outline of information construction in colleges and universities. Based on big data's top-level design, this paper collects and integrates the data from all aspects of college education, extracts valuable information and models from the data, and promotes the overall innovation of college education.
												</p> 			
												<p>	
1. To carry out big data's top-level design and to comprehensively promote the development of the school<br/>
 with the application of big data will become a new driving force to promote the development of the school. Through the top-level design of big data, we will acquire, collect, and sort out big data. Using comprehensive planning, starting from the requirements of the application, defining the purpose and path of construction, defining what to do, what not to do, what should be done first, what should be done later, what mode to do, to what extent, and what results will be achieved; To guide the school in the next 3-5 years of big data construction.
												</p> 			
												<p>	
2. To quickly promote the informatization of teaching and management work, to establish a rich data source <br/>
 to analyze the existing teaching and management work comprehensively with big data's method, to build or upgrade information systems, and to record the whole process of teaching and management.<br/> 
 For example, by upgrading the existing distance education system and jumping out of the concept of distance education, we can fully support the teaching process and record the data of each student's learning behavior in detail. Including course learning data, video viewing data, data retrieval, homework completion data, interactive exchange data, grade data, etc., breaking the data into each behavioral detail to provide data fineness beyond the traditional system, <br/>
 through the establishment of the Internet of things application, realize the strong support to the goods, personnel, safety and other aspects of management, improve the quality of management and accumulate a large amount of management data and behavior data at the same time.
</p>
<p>
3. Based on the demand of individualized service, it is one of the important goals of education and management to establish big data's analysis model <br/> 
to provide excellent individualized service, while big data application is a necessary condition for providing personalized service on a large scale. The quality of big data analysis model determines the value of the data. A data that is usually ignored in a good model can have an unimaginable effect. <br/> 
We can understand students' interest in learning and learning effects by analyzing the learning behavior data. Study which learning methods are the most acceptable and which courses are the most popular, or specific to the correct rate of answer to a homework question and horizontal and vertical comparison, and show the reasons. These data are provided to teachers and will provide the most direct support for teaching innovation. <br/> 
through the analysis of one-card behavior data, we can understand students' daily behavior law and consumption law, and understand students' behavior and learning achievement. The relationship between school effects provides the basis for students' management innovation.
												</p>
												<p>
4. Comprehensive application of big data's achievements to promote the overall innovation of the school <br/>
 through the comprehensive application of big data, the analysis and judgment of various educational and management work can be established and applied to practical work.<br/> 
 Through comprehensive analysis of teaching process, learning behavior, learning achievement, teaching satisfaction, teacher demand, professional teacher quality, professional maturity, track of action, etc. Student portraits, professional portraits, intuitive understanding of advantages and disadvantages, prediction of the development of the situation. <br/> 
 through the number of students, dormitory distribution, classroom use, energy consumption, network consumption, canteen consumption, library utilization, etc. The index of resource utilization is established, the data is visualized, and the management is refined and flat. <br/>
 through the cluster analysis of card, book borrowing, professional distribution, course distribution, achievement, learning behavior, etc. Discover the special group with certain characteristics and its unique behavior, and use the correlation data to mine and discover the rule. <br/> 
 through the teaching data, the teaching effect, the attendance record, the personal data, Comprehensive analysis of management data, the establishment of a scientific, real and objective evaluation system of teacher performance, change the subjectivity of traditional artificial evaluation, allow big data to select real excellent teachers.
